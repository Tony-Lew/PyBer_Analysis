# Ride Sharing Analysis

Analyzing and visualizing ride sharing data using Python

# Overview

This projects purpose was to analyze the Pyber ride sharing data. We looked at the data as a whole then broke it down into 3 ride sharing areas Rural, suburban, and urban. Using this data we can help determine where Pyber can inprove its market shares. We broke this data down for the first third of the fiscal year 2019 and provided a easy to read line graph showing the information we obtained.


# Results

As this image above shows Urban ridership is almost 3 times more then the next Suburban. That being said it barely doubles the total fares, meaning the Urban drivers have more trips going shorter distances then their Suburban counter parts.

Reading this graph above we can see:
  -Urban cities have the highest ridership and Rural cities have the least.
  -The end of February though the end of March where the peak times for Urban fares.
  -During the highest fare week it just under $4500.
  
  #Summary
  
  With my intpretation of this small data set would be to raise prices per ride in the Urban areas. I would keep the Subrurban and Rural price points the same if not even lowering them in the Rural area to try and increase ridership. I would also recomend maintaining the total drivers in all areas as an increase could bring the average fares down, unless you decrease the ride prices in the Rural area, I would then recomend increasing drivers in that area.
